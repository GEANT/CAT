     * Defines various general parameters of the roaming consortium.
     * name: the display name of the consortium
     * ssid: an array of default SSIDs for this consortium; they are automatically added to all installers.
     * interworking-consortium-oi: Organisation Identifier of the roaming consortium for Interworking/Hotspot 2.0; 
     *                             a profile with these OIs will be added to all installers
     * tkipsupport: whether the default SSIDs should be configured for WPA/TKIP and WPA2/AES (TRUE) or only for WPA2/AES (FALSE)
     * homepage: URL of the consortium's general homepage.
     * signer_name: if installers are configured for digital signature, this parameter should contain the "O" name
     *           in the certificate. If left empty, signatures are not advertised even if configured and working
     * allow_self_service_registration: if set to NULL, federation admins need to invite new inst admins manually
     *                                  if set to a federation ID string, e.g. "DE" for Germany, new admins can
     *                                  self-register and will be put into that federation.
     * registration_API_keys: allows select federations to make bulk registrations for new IdPs (e.g. if they have
     *                        an own, opaque, customer management system. The API will be documented at a later stage
     * LOGOS: there are several variants of the consortium logo scattered in the
     *        source. Please change them at the appropriate places:
     *        - web/resources/images/consortium_logo.png
     *        - web/favicon.ico
     *        - devices/ms/Files/eduroam_150.bmp
     *        - devices/ms/Files/eduroam32.ico
     * 
     * certfilename, keyfilename, keypass: if you want to send S/MIME signed mails, just configure the signing cert
     *                                     with these parameters. All must be non-NULL for signing to happen. If you
     *                                     don't need a keypass, make it an empty string instead.
     * silverbullet options:
     *         default_maxusers: an institution is not allowed to create more than that amount of users
     *             the value can be overriden as a per-federation option in fed-operator UI
     *         realm_suffix: user credentials have a realm which always includes the inst ID and profile ID and the name
     *             of the federation; for routing aggregation purposes /all/ realms should end with a common suffix though
     *             if left empty, realms would end in the federation name only
     *         server_suffix: the suffix of the auth server's name. It will be auth.<fedname> followed by this suffix
     *         gracetime: admins need to re-login and verify that accounts are still valid. This prevents lazy admins
     *             who forget deletion of people who have lost their eligibility. The number is an integer value in days
     *         CA: the code can either act as its own CA ("embedded") or use API calls to an external CA. This config
     *             value steers where to get certificates from

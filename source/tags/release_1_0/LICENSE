      reasonably calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You
      for as long as Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and
      by publishing the address of that information repository in a notice

As an express condition for the grants of licence hereunder, You agree
that any Third Party Provision by You of a Derivative Work shall be
deemed a distribution and shall be Licensed to all under the terms of
this Licence, as prescribed in clause 1.1.3 herein.

7 Attribution Rights
--------------------
7.1   You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative Works that
      You create, all copyright, patent or trade mark notices from the Source
      Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
      descriptive text identified therein as an “Attribution Notice”,
      including the following notice:

   "On behalf of the GÉANT project, DANTE is the sole owner of the copyright in all material which was

7.2   You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You
      create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to
      inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work.

8 Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty
---------------------------------------------------
8.1   The Licensor warrants that the copyright in and to the Original
      Work and the patent rights granted herein by Licensor are owned by the
      Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of this Licence with
      the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and patent rights.
8.2   Except as expressly stated in clause 8.1, the Original Work is
      provided under this Licence on an “as is” basis and this Licence
      expressly excludes all implied terms, conditions and warranties to the
      maximum limit permitted by the applicable law. The entire risk as to the
      quality of the Original Work is with you. This disclaimer of warranty
      constitutes an essential part of this Licence. No licence to Original
      Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

9 Limitation of Liability
-------------------------
9.1   This limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for
      death or personal injury resulting from Licensor’s negligence to the
      extent applicable law prohibits such limitation.
9.2   Subject to clause 9.1 and any applicable law, under no
      circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
      negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor be liable to any
      person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential
      damages of any character arising as a result of this Licence or the use
      of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
      goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses.

10 Acceptance and Termination
-----------------------------
10.1  If You distribute copies of the Original Work or a Derivative
      Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
      obtain the express consent (which, for the avoidance of doubt, need not
      be in writing) of recipients to the terms of this Licence.
10.2  Nothing else but this Licence (or another written agreement
      between Licensor and You) grants You permission to create Derivative
      Works or to exercise any of the rights granted in clause 1, and any
      attempt to do so except under the terms of this Licence (or another
      written agreement between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by
      English copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries, and by
      international treaty. Therefore, by exercising any of the rights granted
      to You in clause 1, You irrevocably indicate Your acceptance of
      this Licence and all of its terms and conditions.
10.3  Any failure by you to comply with your obligations under clause
      1.1.3 shall automatically terminate this Licence as well as any rights
      granted to You under this Licence.

11 Legal Fees
-------------
11.1  In any action to enforce the terms of this Licence or seeking
      damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
      recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation,
      reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in connection with such
      action, including any appeal of such action.
11.2  This clause shall survive the termination of this Licence.

12 Termination for Patent Action
--------------------------------
12.1  This Licence shall terminate automatically and You may no longer
      exercise any of the rights granted to You by this Licence as of the date
      You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against
      Licensor or any Licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent.
12.2  This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
      patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other
      software or hardware.

13 Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law
----------------------------------------
13.1  Any action or suit relating to this Licence may be brought only
      in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides or in which
      Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that
      jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.
13.2  Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this Licence or
      after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties
      of English copyright law, the equivalent laws of other countries and
      international treaty.
13.3  This clause shall survive the termination of this Licence.

14 Miscellaneous
----------------
14.1  This Licence represents the entire agreement concerning the
      subject matter hereof and the parties have not relied on any
      representations not included in this Licence when entering into it.
14.2  If any provision of this Licence is held to be unenforceable,
      such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
      enforceable.

15 Right to Use

You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or
conditioned by this Licence or by law, and Licensor promises not to
interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

      Code, that is based on (or derived from) the Original Work and for which
      the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other

      that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the
      interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
16.2  Licensor means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
      that offer(s) the Original Work under the terms of this Licence.
16.3  Object Code means the form of the Original Work resulting from
      mechanical transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation, and
      conversions to other media types.
16.4  Original Work means the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the Licence, as indicated by an
      Attribution Notice that is included in or attached to the work.
16.5  Source Code means the preferred form of the Original Work for
      making modifications to it and all available documentation describing
      how to modify the Original Work.
16.6  Third Party Provision means the use or distribution of the
      Original Work or Derivative Works in any way such that the Original Work
      or Derivative Works may be used by anyone other than You, whether the
      Original Work or Derivative Works are distributed to those persons or
      made available as an application intended for use over a computer network.
16.7  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
      Licence who has not previously violated the terms of this Licence with
      respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
      Licensor to exercise rights under this Licence despite a previous 
      violation. For legal entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is
      controlled by, or is under common control with you. For purposes of this
      definition "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the

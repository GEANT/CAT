In order to configure signing based on scripts in this directory, you must start
with requesting a software signing certificate from a publickly reconisable certificate provider.

You should also obtain and install the osslsigncode package (http://osslsigncode.sourceforge.net/)

If you are using a PFX (P12) file - xxx.pfx start with step 1
If you have speparate certifificate and key in PEM format, go to step 2

Your goal is to produce certificate/key pairs
xxx_cert.spc xxx_key.der   - these are for Windows signing
xxx_cert.pem xxx_key.pem   - these are for Apple mobileconfig signing
for Apple you will also need certificates of all trust path in a CAs.pem file

You can change those names of course, but if you keep them, the you will not have to modify
the scripts

Prepare certificates
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Extract PEM certificate and ke files. The key file cannot be password protected

openssl pkcs12 -in xxx.pfx -nokeys -out xxx_cert.pem
openssl pkcs12 -in xxx.pfx -nocerts -nodes -out xxx_key.pem

2. convert the key from PEM to DER format

openssl rsa -in xxx_key.pem -out xxx_key.der -outform der

3. prepare an SPC file - you will need PEM certificates of all CAs up to the root CA and your code signing certificate
the order of certificate files is irrelevant.

openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl -certfile xxx_cert.pem -certfile CA1.pem -certfile CA2.pem -certfile CA3.pem -outform DER -out xxx.spc

4. Prepare a CAs.pem file by concatenating all CA files:

cat CA1.pem CA2.pem CA3.pem > CAs.pem

5. Copy xxx_cert.spc xxx_key.der xxx_cert.pem xxx_key.pem CAs.pem to the appropriate directory
Beware that this directory must be protected against the WEB download, othewise you keys mey be compromised. 
The directory must be accessible by the Apache proceess


Prepare Scripts
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Copy the template scripts to your working copies:

cp mobileconfig_sign-template  mobileconfig_sign
cp ms_windows_sign-template ms_windows_sign

Modify both scripts by setting MY_PATH pointing to the directory whre you store your keys and certificates.

ms_windows_sign will require defining URL and NAME values 

If you have kept the certificate file names as in this HOWTO then nothing else needs to be modified,
otherwise you need to set file names to their proper values.

Both scripts should be readeable and executable (but not writeable) by the Apache process.

Enable signing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

edit devices/devices.php and change the sign option value form 0 to 1

<title>Introduction</title>
<para>
<emphasis>eduroam Configuration Assistant Tool (CAT)</emphasis> is a user-oriented system helping to configure various wireless devices for eduroam.
</para>
<para>
CAT database contains information provided by local eduroam admins, i.e. items like supported EAP methods, trusted RADIUS server names, trusted server certificates, etc. 
</para>
<para>
CAT installers are device dependant entities (Windows installers, XML profiles, etc.), which carry all institution related information. Such a installer is created when a user selects his/her
 institution, possibly also user group and one of supported devices. Installers are provided in a number of supported languages (please help in translation effort).
</para>
<para>See {@tutorial ModuleWriting.pkg#glossary} for a more detailed description of terms used in this text.

  <refsect1 id="{@id what-is}">
<title>What is a device module and how does it interface with the CAT system?</title>
<para>
Device modules use CAT API to access information in the CAT database and produce installer files. 
</para>
<para>
The module MUST configure the device for accessing the the list of SSIDs passed to it by the CAT module API. The module publishes the
 set of EAP methods it can support, CAT API compares this to the prioritised list of EAP types 
supported by a given profile and returns the most appropriate one. Device module creates a configurator for this EAP method. If the device requires to be separately configured for WPA2/AES and WPA/TKIP then
it should use the information passed by the API, specifying which encryptions must be supported. As a rule, if WPA/TKIP is specified, then WPA2/AES must also be configured for this SSID. 
</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 id="{@id what-does}">
<title>What does the CAT API do for device modules?</title>
<para>
Before passing control to the device module, CAT system prepares a few things for the module to use.These include:
</para>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
interfacing with the user;
</listitem>
<listitem>
getting all configuration parameters from the CAT database;
</listitem>
<listitem>creating a temporary working directory;
</listitem>
<listitem>preparing certificate files and making them ready for storing in the working directory;
</listitem>
<listitem>storing information files in the working directory (possibly changing the character set).
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<para>
After the device module produces the installer file, it leaves it in its working directory and passes back its name. CAT API delivers the file to the user.
</para>
<para>
It is important to understand how the device module fits into the whole picture, so here is s short description.
An external caller (for instance {@link GUI::generateInstaller()}) creates the module device instance and prepares
its environment for a given user profile by calling {@link DeviceConfig::setup()} method.
Finally, the module {@link DeviceConfig::writeInstaller ()} is called and the returned path name is used for user download.

</para>
</refsect1>
<refsect1 id="{@id dir-structure}">
<title>Directory structure and naming</title>
<para>
All device modules reside in the <emphasis>devices</emphasis> directory. Each device module has its own subdirectory.
If a device module requires additional files that will need to be copied to the working directory,
then these files should be placed in the <emphasis>Files</emphasis> subdirectory of the module directory.
</para>
<para>
The name of the module directory may be arbitrary, but the name of the module file and the name of the device class must be synchronised. 
For instance, if the name of the module is <emphasis>TestModule</emphasis>, then it's source file should be called <emphasis>TestModule.php</emphasis>
and the name of the class must be <emphasis>Device_TestModule</emphasis>. 
</para>
<para>
Naming is defined in the {@link devices.php} file, it is a configuration feature and is irrelevant external from the module point of view.
</para>
</refsect1>

<title>Device driver code</title>
<para>
See the {@link TestModule.php} for a working example.
</para>
<para>
We assume, that you are know how to write a device installer itself. 
If not, then this tutorial will not teach you that. It will only show how to get hold
of parameters that you need to build into your code.
</para>
<para>
Typically, to produce an installer you need to know:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>the certificate of the CA which has signed the RADIUS server certificate,
</listitem>
<listitem>the names of the trusted RADIUS servers,
</listitem>
<listitem>the EAP method to be used,
</listitem>
<listitem>the SSIDs to connect to.
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>

 The installer will only work properly for users from one institution and, possibly one user
group, it would be wise to display an appropriate warning. If an institution has only one user group, then it makes no sense to make users aware that this concept exists and device modules should probably try to hide this. The <emphasis>internal:profile_count</emphasis> can be used to check how many profiles a given institution has.
</para>
<para>
In some environments it is possible to display additional text information (perhaps a list of usage terms), it may be also possible to customise the installer graphics by adding the institution logo. 
All these will be available to the device module.
</para>
<para>
The device module class  <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> extend the {@link DeviceConfig} class, thus obtaining access to all methods and properties provided by this class. 
Check the documentation of that class for a complete list.
</para>
<para>
The module class <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> define a constructor and this constructor <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> set
<emphasis>$this->supportedEapMethods</emphasis> to to an array listing EAP methods supported by this particular device.
</para>
<para>
The module <emphasis>MUST</emphasis> define a <emphasis>writeInstaller()</emphasis> method which is to produce the actual installer file.
All useful profile properties are provided within the device's <emphasis>attributes</emphasis> property (see {@link DeviceConfig}) and set by the setup(Profile $profile) method
when a device module is being prepared to be called.
</para>
<para>
 The <emphasis>writeInstaller</emphasis> method must create the installer in the form of a single file in the module.

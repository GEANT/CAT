Changes in release 1.0.2
========================
Configuration parameter changes
-------------------------------
[NEW]          Config::$PATHS['rad_eap_test']
               explicit or implicit specification of rad_eap_test; see FEAT#2

Bugfixes and Features
---------------------
- [BUGFIX #1]  the "Add new options" button for EAP-specific details and device-
               specific details now works
- [BUGFIX #2]  Problem with installer filename generation fixed globally
               by adding a generic approach common to all device modules
- [BUGFIX #3]  heuristics in RADIUS checks tried to be too clever. There is a
               configuration which was diagnosed as error condition, but is not
               necessarily an error. Downgraded to WARNING and an explanation
               was added under which circumstances this is correct behaviour
- [FEATURE #1] after editing IdP details, explicit confirmation which SSIDs with
               which security settings will be configured is displayed
- [FEATURE #2]  rad_eap_test can be configured with an explicit path
               this solves a problem of installations which put this script 
               in non-standard places

               defaults to empty, can be omitted

Bugfixes and Features
---------------------
- [BUGFIX #1]  the name "TERENA" for installer signatures was hard-wired. It
               is now a config item; if omitted, no "signed by" advertising is
               done
- [BUGFIX #2]  use of eduroam DB depended on a heuristics about DB host

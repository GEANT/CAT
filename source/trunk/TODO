Core
----
? Windows modules - NEA
  (nobody seems to demand support for this)
? easy re-branding for deployment (colours, logo)
  (low priority: only relevant for non-eduroam uses of CAT)

Admin Interface
---------------
! Federation customisation
  * custom texts in invitations etc.
  * "default CA" as template for new insts?
  * federation logo to embed in installers?

User Interface
--------------
! self-service troubleshooting for end-users
  (standalone: postponed to beta phase or retrofit for 1.1.x)

Device Modules
--------------
? Linux - big installer GUI (Feature)
? Linux - WICD support
          (postponed: WICD looks very dead at the moment)
? Linux - SUSE XML variant support
          (postponed: looks easy, but nobody actually asked for that)
! Linux - Hotspot 2.0 / Passpoint support (wpa_supplicant only)
          (blocked by: wpa_supplicant D-BUS API does not expose this property)
! Linux - Wired 1X support
          (blocked by: NetworkManager goes into undefined behaviour on non-1X
          networks is 1X is configured)

    In order to continue we will need to install the SecureW2 component which was
    downloaded in binary form from http://securew2.org/community/ in 2009.
    The information we received as to the offer to distribute corresponding
    source code was: 'the source code is available via Subversion through
    the following link: https://svn.securew2.com/SecureW2_NG'

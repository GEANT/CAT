CAT, the Configuration Assistant Tool for Enterprise Wi-Fi networks such as eduroam
===================================================================================

CAT collects information about RADIUS/EAP deployments from Wi-Fi network administrators and generates simple-to-use, good-looking, and secure installation programs for users of these networks. The goal is to vastly improve the network security by pushing secure Wi-Fi settings to all users without the need to expose them to or require them to understand all of the underlying technologies and configuration parameters.

eduroam CAT User Manuals
------------------------
The flagship of CAT, the eduroam CAT (https://cat.eduroam.org), has extensive documentation (with screenshots!) of CAT. You may want to read those for an overview of the features.

eduroam CAT federation administrator documentation: https://wiki.geant.org/display/H2eduroam/A+guide+to+eduroam+CAT+for+federation+administrators

eduroam CAT institution administrator documentation: https://wiki.geant.org/display/H2eduroam/A+guide+to+eduroam+CAT+for+institution+administrators

There is no documentation for end users, simply because it's so easy to use on the end-user side that no documentation is required! :-)

Previous Versions of CAT
------------------------
The 1.0.x and 1.1.x versions of CAT were developed on a SVN server of the GEANT project. Please refer to https://forge.geant.net/forge/display/CAT/Home for access to the source code and release tarballs of these earlier versions.

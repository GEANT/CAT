IdP.php 
  changed certificate handling in addCA, so that the certificate would be
  always available in both PEM and DER format. 
  Also changed the way in which we determine if the certificate is in the PEM
  format, to avoid the warning message from openssl_x509_read.
  The return array from addCA now contains the pem and der fields.

  $FPATH_main and $FPATH properties have been added
  createTemporaryDirectory method was added
  saveCertificateFiles function was added

  Certificates and profiles are now saved in a temporary subdirectory 
  if the directory pointed to by $FPATH_main
